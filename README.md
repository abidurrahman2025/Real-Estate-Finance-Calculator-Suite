A polished, modular collection of real-estate finance calculators — web UI, Java utilities, and Python analysis scripts — designed for investors, agents, and developers who need accurate, reproducible property financial modeling.

Why this project exists
- Real estate investing requires repeated financial calculations (mortgages, cash flow, ROI, IRR, cap rates, amortization). This repo centralizes common calculators and tools into a single, extensible suite.
- Built to be accessible: an HTML front-end for quick use, Java components for production-ready integration, and Python scripts for data analysis and automation.

Repository language composition
- HTML: 63.7%
- Java: 23.0%
- Python: 13.3%

Features
- Mortgage amortization (monthly payment, amortization schedule with principal/interest breakdown)
- Cash flow and NOI (net operating income)
- Cap rate and Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)
- Cash-on-cash return
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and NPV calculators for multi-period cash flows
- Refinance and break-even analysis
- Comparative investment scenario tool (side-by-side)
- Clean, responsive HTML UI for quick checks + reusable Java & Python modules for integration and analysis

Quick demo — sample calculations
- Mortgage monthly payment (annuity formula)
  - Inputs: principal $P, annual interest rate r (as percent), term years n
  - Monthly rate: i = r / 12
  - Payments: M = P * i * (1+i)^(12n) / ((1+i)^(12n) - 1)
  - Example: P = $300,000, r = 4.0%, n = 30 -> M ≈ $1,432.25

- Cap rate
  - CapRate = NetOperatingIncome / PurchasePrice
  - Example: NOI = $28,000, Price = $400,000 -> CapRate = 7%

Getting started (local)
1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abidurrahman2025/Real-Estate-Finance-Calculator-Suite.git
   cd Real-Estate-Finance-Calculator-Suite
   ```

2. Quick web UI (fastest)
   - Open the HTML front-end in your browser:
     - Open `web/index.html` (or `index.html` at project root) in any modern browser.
   - No server required for basic calculators.

3. Java components
   - If the Java code uses Maven:
     ```
     cd java
     mvn clean package
     # run jar if present
     java -jar target/real-estate-calculators.jar
     ```
   - If no build tool is present, compile with javac:
     ```
     javac -d out src/main/java/com/realestate/**/*.java
     java -cp out com.realestate.Main
     ```
   - The Java modules are designed for integration into backend services; they expose calculator classes with simple method signatures (e.g., MortgageCalculator.computeMonthlyPayment(...)).

4. Python scripts & analysis
   - Install dependencies (if any):
     ```
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r python/requirements.txt
     ```
   - Run an analysis script:
     ```
     python python/irrcalc.py --cashflows cashflows.csv
     ```
   - Python modules are ideal for batch processing, CSV import/export, and Jupyter notebook analysis.

Folder layout (recommended / example)
- web/ or public/ — HTML, CSS, and client-side JS (primary interactive UI)
- java/ — Java library and example CLI or server integration
- python/ — scripts, notebooks, data import utilities
- docs/ — design docs, formulas, test cases
- tests/ — unit tests for Java and Python modules
- examples/ — sample data and pre-filled demo scenarios

Usage examples (snippets)

- Mortgage (Python example)
```
from calculators.mortgage import monthly_payment
pmnt = monthly_payment(principal=300000, annual_rate=0.04, years=30)
print(f"Monthly Payment: ${pmnt:,.2f}")
```

- Java (conceptual usage)
```java
MortgageCalculator mc = new MortgageCalculator(300000, 0.04, 30);
double monthly = mc.getMonthlyPayment();
System.out.println("Monthly = " + monthly);
```

Testing & validation
- Unit tests for calculators are strongly recommended. If present:
  - Java: `mvn test` or `gradle test`
  - Python: `pytest tests/`
- Compare outputs with authoritative sources (bank amortization tables, Excel) to validate correctness.

Contributing
We welcome contributors.
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Add tests and documentation for your change.
4. Open a pull request describing the change and motivation.

Suggested PR checklist
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Linting passes (Java/Python/HTML)
- [ ] README updated (if functionality changes)
- [ ] Backward-compatible API changes

Coding style
- Java: follow standard conventions; include Javadoc for public methods.
- Python: follow PEP8; include docstrings and type hints where appropriate.
- HTML/CSS/JS: accessibility and responsive layout for calculators.

Roadmap (ideas)
- Add a REST API wrapper for Java calculators (Spring Boot example)
- Docker images for reproducible execution (web + API)
- Add more advanced financial models (sensitivity analysis, scenario Monte Carlo)
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks with data visualization (rental yield heatmaps)
- Localization (currencies, number formats, tax rules by country)

FAQ / Troubleshooting
Q: I opened the HTML and UI doesn't load correctly.
A: Ensure you opened the correct `index.html`, and if the page fetches a local API, run the backend services or serve the directory with a static server:
```
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

Q: How can I trust the math?
A: The repo includes unit tests and formula references in `docs/` (if not present, please raise an issue). Always cross-check results against your financial advisor for decisions.

Acknowledgements
- Based on standard financial formulas (time value of money, annuity formulas).
- Contributions and ideas from the real estate investing community.

Need help customizing this README?
Tell me which calculators you want emphasized, or paste your folder layout and I’ll tailor the "How to run" and examples to the repo's exact structure (I can also draft a CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md next).
